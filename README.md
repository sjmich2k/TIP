## THE INTANGIBLE PERFORMANCE
A python prototyping commission from Marie Kang for her masters graduation project.

DISCLAIMER: this is a prototype, so the code structure might not be very pretty or optimized.

### How to use
1. Clone repository and `cd` into repository root using command prompt (or your favorite IDE)
2. Create new virtual environment with `python -m venv venv`
3. Activate the virtual environment 
   - on Windows: `venv\Scripts\activate`
   - on macOS: `source venv/bin/activate`
4. Install dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`
5. Run main.py using `python main.py`
